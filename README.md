# JustLifeAssignement
This is an automation testing framework built with Cucumber, Selenium WebDriver, and JUnit for testing JustLife web application.
It uses Cucumber to define tests using Gherkin, making it easy to understand for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
Selenium WebDriver is used for interacting with the web application (such as opening pages, clicking buttons, filling out forms, etc.).
JUnit is used as the test execution engine to run Cucumber tests.
This framework allows the creation of reusable step definitions and generates detailed HTML report for test execution results.
